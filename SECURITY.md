Security is a top priority in this project. This policy outlines how to report vulnerabilities and how we handle them.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

   - The potential impact and possible exploitation scenarios.
   - Any other relevant information that can help us understand and resolve the issue.

2. **Responsible Disclosure:**
